Front-end Web Design Project Reflection

**bold text**
Before starting the project, I spent some time researching the principles and best practices of responsive web design. I browsed a variety of websites, focusing on the unique designs they used on their pages that could be incorporated into my web pages, paying special attention to how they rendered on different devices, and used the Web Inspector to understand how media queries and breakpoints affected the layout. This process gave me a better understanding of the importance of responsive design and how to implement it using HTML and CSS.

Once I had an understanding of responsive design, I began the actual design and coding process. To ensure good performance on different devices, I used media queries to adjust the layout and style. I paid special attention to the differences between mobile devices and desktop monitors and made sure that the content would display clearly and lay out well on all three screen sizes.

Ensuring that a website is responsive on different devices requires a deep understanding of CSS and needs to take into account the screen sizes, resolutions, and orientations of different devices. It requires testing and debugging to ensure that it displays correctly on all devices, taking into account how different components appear on different devices, as well as their layout relationships and interactivity. The process may require a lot of trial and adjustment to find the best solution.

Overall, this project helped me deepen my understanding of responsive design and improve my front-end web design skills. By researching, implementing, and documenting the entire process, I not only learned new knowledge and techniques, but also developed the ability to solve problems and improve the user experience.

Where the project aligns with the concepts, skills and theories of front-end web design

**bold text**

application of responsive design principles: responsive design is one of the core concepts of modern web design. In this project, the principles of responsive design were met through the use of media queries and other CSS techniques to ensure that the website displays well on different devices. This involves adapting to different screen sizes, resolutions and orientations and providing an optimal user experience.

Hands-on HTML and CSS skills: The project requires the implementation of a range of HTML markup and styles, which requires a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. From selecting and using HTML markup to applying styles and layouts, it requires some understanding and practice of front-end development skills.
